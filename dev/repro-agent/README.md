# repro-agent

Reproduce a bug **live in your running Omnigent app** and capture it as a
durable end-to-end test. It runs against whatever server you already have (the
server `omnigent run` spins up, or one you pass with `--server`) and authors the
reproduction test into **this** checkout.

## Prerequisites

- A configured Claude provider (`omnigent setup` — an Anthropic API key, a
  Claude subscription, an OpenAI-compatible gateway, or a Databricks workspace).
  The agent's brain runs on the Claude Agent SDK.
- `gh` authenticated (`gh auth login`) if your `bug_url` is a GitHub issue, so
  the agent can read the report.
- Run it **from the root of your `omnigent-ai/omnigent` checkout** so the agent's
  working directory is this repo and it can author tests into `tests/e2e_ui/` or
  `tests/e2e/`.

## Usage

```bash
# Against the server `omnigent run` spins up:
omnigent run dev/repro-agent \
  -p '{"bug_url":"https://github.com/omnigent-ai/omnigent/issues/1234"}'

# Against a server you already run:
omnigent run dev/repro-agent --server http://localhost:6767 \
  -p '{"bug_url":"https://linear.app/omnigent/issue/OMNI-1234","ref":"v1.2.3"}'
```

The `-p` payload is the input contract — `bug_url` (required) plus an optional
`ref` (the version the bug was reported on; informational).

## What it does

1. Reconstructs the user journey from the linked bug report.
2. Drives the running app through that journey — browser tools for UI bugs,
   `sys_session_*` / HTTP for backend bugs — until it observes the failure.
3. Authors a durable e2e test (`tests/e2e_ui/` for UI, `tests/e2e/` for backend)
   keyed to the concrete failure, so a fix has a fail→pass regression guard.
4. Emits a structured verdict (`reproduced` / `not_reproduced` / `already_fixed`
   / `needs_more_info`) with the test path, session id, journey, and evidence.

It does **not** fix the bug, merge, or push — it produces a live-confirmed
reproduction plus the test and hands off. The authored test lands in your working
tree (`git status` to see it).

See `AGENTS.md` for the full operating procedure.
