# resolve-agent — recurring repo pitfalls checklist

A growing rubric of **mistake classes worth checking every fix against**. The
resolve-agent feeds this to its cross-vendor reviewer (AGENTS.md Step 2B.6) so the
reviewer checks for each item explicitly instead of re-deriving them every run.
These are *correctness* concerns, not style — a reviewer must surface them even
when a prompt says to skip cosmetic nits.

**Grow this file.** When a review (the pre-PR reviewer, the PR bots, or a human)
catches a class of bug that a resolve-agent fix introduced, add it here as a
one-line check so the next run catches it up front. Keep each item concrete:
what to look for, and why it's wrong.

## Tests / hermeticity

- **Env-absent tests must clear *every* relevant ambient variable.** A test
  asserting an environment-derived value is absent/None/default must clear **all**
  of the variables the code-under-test reads in its fixture — not just the obvious
  one. A fixture that clears some but leaves a sibling ambient passes on a clean
  machine and flakes in CI where that var is exported.
- **No order-dependence / shared mutable state** across tests — a test that only
  passes after another ran, or mutates a module/global without restoring it.

## UI / affordances

- **Don't offer an action the code can't perform.** Flag a menu/UI option gated on
  a *resolved* value rather than on whether the action can actually act on it —
  e.g. offering to remove/clear a value that only exists ambiently and that the
  underlying edit cannot remove. Gate the affordance on "can we act on this," not
  "did something resolve."

## Environment / subprocess

- **Never replace a child's whole environment.** Passing a fresh `env=` to
  `subprocess.*` that drops the inherited environment strips `PATH`, auth, and
  proxy vars — extend `os.environ.copy()` instead of replacing it.

## Config / data safety

- **A "clear/reset" must not clobber unrelated config.** An edit that rewrites a
  config file to remove one key must preserve every other key — no full-file
  overwrite that drops the user's other settings.
