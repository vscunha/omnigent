"""E2E: the Files rail "Working folder" header is a static label, not a toggle.

The desktop Workspace rail renders ``FilesPanel`` in its ``frameless``
(inline) mode. The working-folder header is a plain label: the file list is
the whole point of the panel, so there is nothing to collapse to. The header
must NOT be a button and the panel content (the file list / search) must be
visible with no toggle needed.

This is the regression guard against reintroducing the collapse chevron: the
header once doubled as a collapse toggle carrying ``aria-expanded``, which
made no sense in a panel whose only content is the file list. No message is
sent — the header is rail state, not a function of any turn — so this stays a
fast, LLM-free check.
