"""Generic shell-command parsing shared by built-in shell-surface policies.

Built-in policies that gate the OS shell tool (``github`` for git/gh remote
operations, ``working_dir`` for directory / worktree switches) all face the
same problem: a single ``sys_os_shell`` ``command`` string can chain several
commands (``a && b ; c``), prefix them with env-assignments or wrappers
(``sudo``, ``env``, ``VAR=x``), and hide the real command inside a shell
interpreter (``bash -c "<cmd>"``) or ``eval``. A policy that only looked at
the first token would be trivially bypassable.

This module factors out the *generic* primitives for breaking a command into
its individual real invocations. It is deliberately policy-agnostic — it does
not know about git, directories, or any domain; each policy composes these
primitives with its own classification and decision logic (including its own
handling of un-tokenizable segments, which differs per policy).

def split_command_segments(command: str) -> list[str]:
    """
    Split a shell command on chaining operators into individual segments.

    Splits on ``&&``, ``||``, ``;``, ``|``, a single ``&`` (the background
    operator, also a command separator), and newlines so that
    ``git add . && git push`` is evaluated as two segments. The ``&&``
    alternative is matched before the single-``&`` character class, so a
    ``&&`` is consumed whole rather than split into two empty halves.
    Command substitutions (``$(...)`` / backticks) are pulled out first and
    their bodies appended as their own segments, so a command hidden inside one
    (``x=$(git push <url>)``) is still gated. This is a naive split that does
    not honor operators appearing inside quotes — acceptable because the
    commands these policies gate do not embed these operators in quoted args in
    practice, and a mis-split only ever produces an extra ignored segment.

    Splitting on a lone ``&`` matters for the gate: without it, a benign
    leading command could hide a gated one behind a background operator
    (``echo hi & git push`` would be one un-split segment whose head is
    ``echo``, slipping the ``git push`` past detection).
