"""Centralized error handling for the omnigent server.

All user-facing errors should be raised as OmnigentError with an
appropriate error code. The FastAPI exception handler (registered in
server/app.py) catches these and returns a JSON response with the
correct HTTP status code.

Existing HTTPException usage continues to work — FastAPI handles both.
New code should prefer OmnigentError for consistency.

    :cvar INVALID_INPUT: Request validation failed (HTTP 400).
    :cvar ALREADY_EXISTS: Duplicate resource (HTTP 409).
    :cvar CONFLICT: Operation conflicts with current state (HTTP 409).
    :cvar INTERNAL_ERROR: Unexpected server error (HTTP 500).
    :cvar HARNESS_PROTOCOL_VIOLATION: A harness emitted an SSE
        sequence that violates the Omnigent↔harness contract — e.g.
        ``response.completed`` with outstanding elicitations or
        outstanding ``tool_results`` round-trips. Server bug in
        the harness implementation, not user input. Surfaces as
        the ``error.code`` on a ``TaskStatus.FAILED`` response
        (HTTP 500). See ``designs/SERVER_HARNESS_CONTRACT.md``
        §Elicitation completion invariant.
    :cvar RUNNER_UNAVAILABLE: No online runner can serve the
        requested dispatch (HTTP 503).
    :cvar WRONG_REPLICA: The session's bound runner exists but its
        tunnel is not registered on the replica that served this request
        (HTTP 400). When replicas are sharded by host, a request keyed for
        one host can reach a replica that doesn't hold its tunnel — the key
        doesn't match where the tunnel lives. The request itself is valid
        (the same bytes succeed on the right replica), so the fix is to
        re-address it: reissue WITHOUT the key and reach the host via the
        default route. Distinct from ``RUNNER_UNAVAILABLE`` (no runner
        bound anywhere), which no re-addressing can fix.
    :cvar UNAUTHORIZED: No valid authentication credentials (HTTP 401).
    :cvar FORBIDDEN: Authenticated but insufficient permissions (HTTP 403).
    :cvar RUNNER_CAPABILITY_MISMATCH: The selected runner cannot
        spawn the requested harness kind (HTTP 503).
    :cvar HARNESS_NOT_CONFIGURED: The session's harness is not
        configured on the selected host — its CLI is missing or no
        default credential is set (the host refused the launch with
        the ``harness_not_configured`` error code). HTTP 412
        rather than 400 (the request is valid against a configured
        host) or 503 (retrying cannot succeed without user action —
        running ``omnigent setup`` on the host machine).
    :cvar WORKSPACE_MISSING: The session's bound workspace no longer
        exists on the selected host (HTTP 410). Retrying cannot recreate
        deleted workspace state; the user must start a session in a valid
        workspace.
